| November 24 | 4:00 - 6:00 pm | Today I was thinking about the 8 bit run lengths vs 5 bit run lengths, and I was thinking that using a 5 bit run length would help increase the compression because I think since each run length count costs us bits, the less amount of bits we use for the counter the more compression we will have potentially. |
